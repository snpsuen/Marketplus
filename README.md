# Marketplus
Marketplus is a refined version on the Marketplace Dapp featured in the Solidity/Ethereum [tutorial](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/how-to-build-a-blockchain-app), whereby changes are primarily applied to the structure and purchase of the products on sale.
1. Each product on sale is assigned a random but unique product ID.
2. Each product on sale is recorded with a quantity in stock.
3. Number of items needs to be speicifed when a product is purchased.
